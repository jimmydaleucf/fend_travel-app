# My Udacity Capstone Project (Front End Developer Nanodegree)
This project is to demostrate my new abilities in front end web development.  The skills that i have gained over this course include html, css, javascript, DOM manipulation, build tools such as WebPack and a whole lot more! 

## Welcome to my Travel app!
This application makes use of three public and free API's. Geonames, Weatherbit, and Pixabay. 
To run this application locally, you must:
1. change your node version to v14.x
2. npm install (to install all dependencies)
3. npm run build-dev (this starts both the webpack dev server as well as the express server required to run the application)

Feel free to let me know what you think and if you have any suggestions on how to improve my application!
